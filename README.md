## Questions of Interest

1. **What is the current state of emergency food accessibility in Seattle?**
   - Where are operational emergency food banks and meals in Seattle today?
   - How accessible are they via public transportation?

2. **How can we make more accessible emergency food banks?**
   - Can we find the best locations for new food banks such that they would serve an under-served area of Seattle and be accessible by public transportation?
   - Are there any existing food banks that don't have enough public transportation access?

## Project Goal & Output

We will produce a web application that allows users to:
- **View a Map of Operational Emergency Food Banks/Meals** - Visual representation of food banks and meals within Seattle
- **Filter for their needs** - Filter based on food bank operation times or who they serve
- **Get Directions** - See public transportation routes to a food bank when selected. 

**Deliverables:**
- Interactive web application
- Research findings to questions above
