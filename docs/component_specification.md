    - Inputs:
        - Map events (ie. click, zoom, etc)
        - User filters, a dictionary specifying the values to filter on
        - Food bank location data, a filtered array of objects specifying the food bank ids and corresponding GIS data -- see getFoodBank component
        - Bus route location data, an array of objects specifying the transit route ids and corresponding GIS data -- see getBusRoutes component
    - Outputs:
        - Map object (ie. OpenLayers map instance)
    - Assumptions: Input data is filtered and valid
    - Potential libraries: Openlayers, OpenStreetMaps
- Name: foodBankDisplay
    - What it does: Displays detailed text information about food banks in a side pane

    - Outputs:
        - Rendered list of food banks with detailed information
    - Assumptions: None
- Name: getFoodBanks (control logic)
    - What it does: Retrieves and filters food bank data from a static datastore
    - Inputs:
        - User filters, a dictionary specifying the values to filter on
    - Outputs:
        - An array of objects specifying the food bank ids and corresponding GIS data + food bank details
    - Assumptions: Filters are valid
- Name: getBusRoutes (control logic)
    - What it does: Retrieves bus route from a static datastore for a given food bank
    - Input:
        - Food bank location, a dictionary specifying the latitude and longitude
    - Output:
        - An array of objects specifying the available transit route ids and corresponding GIS data
    - Assumptions: Filters are valid
